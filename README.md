# Task: Develop a simple interface screen
* Objectives

  * A pull request containing a new interface screen, created using the NUI Quick Start Tutorial, is submitted to the Sample module's repository.

  * Modify info area to contain information from an in-game system of your choice. A static piece of text - like an interesting or inspiring quote - is fine too!

  * Screenshot of your new UI screen open in-game

# Notes
  * Use the base NUI via github as a starting point
  * After getting a new repo via ```git clone https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology.git``` ./gradlew idea needed to be run to re initialize the terasology file for IntelliJ Idea to use Terasology.ipr
  * Attempted to get the sample directory by using the command ```git clone https://github.com/Terasology/Sample.git``` while in the Terasology. I decided to move the newly downloaded file into the 'Modules' directory.
  * A better way to get the sample directory is ```groovyw module get Sample``` the previous way gets the wrong directory.
