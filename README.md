# Task: Develop a simple interface screen
* Objectives

  * A pull request containing a new interface screen, created using the NUI Quick Start Tutorial, is submitted to the Sample module's repository.

  * Modify info area to contain information from an in-game system of your choice. A static piece of text - like an interesting or inspiring quote - is fine too!

  * Screenshot of your new UI screen open in-game
